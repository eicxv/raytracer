# raytracer
Rust raytracer written as a means to learn rust.

Originally based on the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend series](https://raytracing.github.io/), expanded with the [rendering course at TU Wien](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Rendering/VU) and the [pbr-book](https://www.pbr-book.org/).

Supports triangle meshes, multithreading and BVH with SAH.
